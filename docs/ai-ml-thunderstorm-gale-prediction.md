# AI/ML-based Prediction of Thunderstorms and Gale Speed

## 1. Introduction
Unpredictable thunderstorms and high gale speeds pose significant risks to aviation, marine operations, urban infrastructure, and disaster management. Rapid onset and localized severity make traditional rule-based forecasting insufficient at fine spatial/temporal scales.

Accurate prediction improves early warnings, routing and scheduling, resource allocation, and public safety.

Project goal: To develop an AI/ML model that predicts thunderstorms and gale speed based on historical and real-time weather data.

## 2. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Data sources
  - IMD station/synop/Metar bulletins (India), storm reports
  - NOAA: GHCN/ISD surface observations, NEXRAD (where applicable)
  - ECMWF ERA5/ERA5-Land reanalysis (hourly gridded variables)
  - NASA: GPM precipitation, GOES/INSAT-3D/3DR satellite products (cloud top temp, brightness)
  - Kaggle weather datasets (for prototyping), lightning networks (WWLLN/GLD360) if accessible
  - Real-time feeds: Open-Meteo, OpenWeatherMap, IMD APIs (where allowed)
- Core features (per station/grid-time)
  - Temperature (2m), dew point, humidity, pressure (MSLP), pressure tendency
  - Wind speed, wind direction, wind gust; u/v components; shear (Δwind across levels if available)
  - Precipitation rate/accumulation, CAPE/CIN (reanalysis), cloud fraction, cloud-top temperature
  - Temporal context: hour-of-day, day-of-year, season, location (lat/lon/elevation)
- Data cleaning and missing values
  - Time alignment and resampling (e.g., to 10-min or hourly cadence, timezone → UTC)
  - Remove duplicates/outliers (range checks, Hampel filter), unit normalization
  - Imputation: forward-fill short gaps, KNN/iterative imputer for longer gaps; drop if above threshold
- Feature engineering
  - Gust factor = max_gust / wind_speed; wind variability (std, IQR over rolling windows)
  - Pressure fall rate (hPa/3h), temperature/humidity tendencies (Δ over 1h/3h)
  - Rolling stats and lags: {mean, std, min, max} over {1h, 3h, 6h}; lags t-1..t-6
  - Directional features: sin/cos encoding of wind direction and hour-of-day
  - Event labels:
    - Thunderstorm (binary): derived from lightning density threshold, storm reports, or synop codes
    - Gale speed (regression target): max sustained wind or gust over next horizon (e.g., next 1–3h)

## 3. Methodology
- Tasks
  - Thunderstorm occurrence classification (binary, possibly probabilistic output)
  - Gale speed prediction (regression on sustained/gust)
  - Option A: Two separate models; Option B: Multi-task model with shared features
- Model candidates
  - Tree ensembles: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost (strong tabular baselines)
  - Temporal models: LSTM/GRU, Temporal CNN/TCN, 1D Conv + attention
  - Hybrid: Feature-engineered tabular + sequence windowing (e.g., last 6–12 steps)
- Train/validation/test
  - Time-based split to prevent leakage (train: past, val: recent past, test: most recent)
  - Blocked/rolling-origin cross-validation for time series; spatial holdout if multi-location
- Handling imbalance (for thunderstorms)
  - Class weights, focal loss (DL), threshold tuning using PR curve
  - Avoid random shuffling; no naive SMOTE on time series
- Hyperparameter tuning
  - Bayesian/Optuna search with early stopping; evaluate on blocked CV folds
- Performance metrics
  - Classification: Precision, Recall, F1, PR-AUC, ROC-AUC, Brier score, calibration error
  - Regression: RMSE, MAE, MAPE (report with wind units), R^2
  - Operational: Lead-time hit rate, false alarm rate, timeliness

## 4. System Architecture
Flow: Data ingestion → Preprocessing/Feature store → Model training → Batch/stream prediction → Visualization/Alerts

Simple view:
[Sources (IMD/NOAA/ERA5/Sat)] -> [ETL + QC + Feature Engineering] -> [Model Train + Tune] -> [Model Registry] -> [Batch/Streaming Inference] -> [Dashboards + Alerts (SMS/Email/Webhook)]

Notes
- Batch: Re-train nightly/weekly with backfill
- Streaming: Ingest latest obs, compute features, infer, publish alerts
- Components (example stack): Python, Pandas, scikit-learn/XGBoost/PyTorch, Optuna, MLflow, FastAPI, Redis/Kafka, Grafana

## 7. Limitations & Future Scope
- Limitations

  - Real-time IoT integration (AWS IoT/Core, edge stations)
  - Probabilistic forecasting (quantile regression, NGBoost), uncertainty-aware alerts
  - Deployment as API with CI/CD, monitoring, drift detection, and periodic retraining

## 8. Conclusion
We outlined a practical AI/ML pipeline to predict thunderstorms (classification) and gale speed (regression) from historical and real-time data. With robust preprocessing, time-aware validation, and calibrated probabilistic outputs, the system can improve early warnings and operational safety. Future enhancements target deeper temporal modeling, multi-modal data fusion, and production-grade real-time deployment.
